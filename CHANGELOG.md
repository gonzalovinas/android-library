messages should update to this version.

Version 9.5.0 - September 4, 2018

to display fullscreen on smaller devices.

Changes
-------
- Added support for tag group audience conditions for in-app messages.
- Added `isReady` method to InAppMessageAdapter so that adapters can
  wait for custom app conditions to be fulfilled before displaying
- Fixed media layout in the modal in-app messages when using template HEADER_MEDIA_BODY.
- Fixed videos autoplaying in an in-app message.

Version 9.4.2 - August 7, 2018

Version 9.4.1 - July 26, 2018
=============================

Patch release that fixes a bug in the json matcher that caused app version equality checks to malfunction.
Apps that use in-app automation with version triggers or audience conditions should update.

Changes
-------
- Fixed JsonMatcher scope parsing.


Version 9.4.0 - July 19, 2018
=============================

Minor release that adds new NotificationFactory APIs to better handle limited background
time when building notifications. This release also addresses ANRs from the GCM and ADM
Broadcast Receiver that occur when notification building takes longer than 10 seconds when
using a custom notification factory. To avoid the ANR, the braodcast will wait a max of 10
seconds before finishing received broadcast instead of waiting for the notification to
finish. This will prevent the ANR from occurring, but the OS might kill the app before it
has time to display the notification and it will be lost. To avoid this issue, either use
`NotificationFactory#createNotificationResult(PushMessage, int, boolean)` to retry later
if the notification is taking too long, or use `NotificationFactory#requiresLongRunningTask(PushMessage)`
if the notification requires more than 10 seconds.

Changes
-------
- Deprecated `NotificationFactory#createNotificationResult(PushMessage, int)` in favor of `NotificationFactory#createNotificationResult(PushMessage, int, boolean)` that also tells the factory if it has longer than 10 seconds to build the notification.
- Added listener to the Whitelist class to reject URLs.
- Added method to generate AirshipConfigOptions from a Properties instance.
- Fixed ANRs caused by slow notification builds in custom factories when using GCM or ADM modules.
- Fixed issue where HTML in-app automation messages were cancelled instead being displayed.


Version 9.3.2 - June 28, 2018
=============================

Fixed an issue where if you define an end time on a automation schedule (action or in-app messages),
it would mark it as expired during the next app init, even if the schedule was not still current. Any app
using either action automation or in-app messages should update.

Changes
-------
- Fixed marking current schedules with an end time as expired.

Version 9.3.1 - June 15, 2018
=============================

Fixed issues with in-app automation not displaying due to the display being paused by default. Apps

the user, exposes information on the ResolutionInfo, and adds a new NotificationFactory create method
that allows retrying a failed notification at a later time. This release also includes fixes to the
Rate App Action crashing on Marshmallow and older devices. Applications that use the rate
app action should update.

Changes
-------
- Added message extenders to the InAppMessageManager.
- Added a new optional createNotification method that returns status.

updates. For FCM migration, please follow the [FCM Migration Guide](https://github.com/urbanairship/android-library/blob/master/documentation/migration/migration-guide-fcm.md).

Changes
-------
- Added support for FCM Google Play Services dependency.
- When using `urbanairship-fcm`, setting the FCM sender ID in the airship config options is now optional.
- Moved push providers into own packages - `urbanairship-fcm`, `urbanairship-gcm`, `urbanairship-adm`,

  that depends on gcm, adm, and core to prevent breaking apps.

  view types that are fully configurable, including modal, banner, and fullscreen. An
  in-app message is able to be triggered using the same rules as the Action automation
  module.
- A rate app action to prompt the user to rate the application.
- Automation schedule priority: Used to determine the execution order of schedules
  if multiple schedules are triggered by the same event.
- Support for editing automation schedules.
- New active session automation trigger. The trigger will increment its count
  if it has been scheduled during an active session instead of waiting for the next
  foreground.

to prevent pulling in the architecture components. Applications that want to use 26.1.0 can continue
to do so by defining 26.1.0 in the app's build.gradle file. The SDK is still fully compatible with 26.1.0.

Changes
-------
- Change support library version to 26.0.2.


Version 8.9.3 - October 17, 2017

Fixes a NPE during channel registration if the devices do not have any tags set. Apps running

Bug Fixes
---------
- Added null checks to prevent a very rare potential null pointer exception when an intent is received without extras in the AdmPushReceiver.

Version 8.7.0 - July 18, 2017
=============================

New Features
------------
- Added a fallback job scheduler using the Android Jobs API for Lollipop+ devices when the GcmNetworkManager
  is unavailable. By default, Urban Airship will schedule jobs with Ids between 3000000 - 3000099.
  The start ID can be changed from 3000000 by adding metadata to the AndroidManifest.xml with
  a new start ID under the key `com.urbanairship.job.JOB_ID_START`. The new scheduler can also be prioritized
  over the GcmNetworkManger scheduler by adding metadata `com.urbanairship.job.PREFER_ANDROID_JOB_SCHEDULER`
  with the value `true`.
- Added ability to disable the GcmNetworkManger scheduler by adding the metadata `com.urbanairship.job.DISABLE_GCM_SCHEDULER`
  with the value `false` to the AndroidManifest.xml.


Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed warning logs about starting services while the device is in the background on Android O.
- Fixed trying to use the alarm manager to schedule jobs as a fallback on Android O when the GcmNetworkManager is unavailable.

=============================

New Features
------------
- Android O compatibility.
- Added support for setting the default notification channel in Airship Config options.
- Added support for setting the notification channel per push from the push API.
- Added a default notification channel. Currently the default channel's name and description is only
  available in english. Other localizations will be provided in an SDK update.

Behavior Changes
----------------
- Android O devices will only have 10 seconds to process a push notification. Custom notification factories
  that require more time can implement `public boolean requiresLongRunningTask(PushMessage message)` to have
  the SDK schedule a job to process the notification when the application has more than 10 seconds.
- Listening for location updates no longer keeps the LocationService alive in the background and is
  only supported on the main process.
- Push messages that are associated with a message center message will no longer wait for the inbox
  to be refreshed. Custom message center implementations should be updated to handle the message
  not being available when the user tries to deep link to the message.
- Fetching images for a big picture notification style will timeout after 10 seconds. If the image times out,
  the notification will be posted without the big picture style.

Bug Fixes

   in Urban Airship API calls.

   ID's messages will be handled by Urban Airship. The rest will be ignored.
 - Simplified push integration. The push intent receiver is now optional and the library
   supports automatically launching the application if the push intent receiver is not
   set or does not handle the open notification broadcasts.

   been updated. A base broadcast receiver 'BaseIntentReceiver' can be extended
   to parse the intents and provide convenient listener style callbacks.
 - It is no longer necessary to check for Urban Airship Actions when deciding to
   launch the application in the push intent receiver.

Packaging Changes

   have to import the library as a project and reference it in the projects settings. An
   aar package is provided for Android Studio users.
